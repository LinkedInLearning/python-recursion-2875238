# Python: Recursion
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Python: Recursion. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

![Python: Recursion][lil-thumbnail-url] 
Recursion is part of the very fabric of computer science and software development, and whether you rarely use it or if it’s a key part of your development, there’s a good chance recursion is happening behind the scenes. Recursion is a powerful tool in breaking down complex problems into more manageable segments, and knowledge of recursion is a desirable trait that employers look for in developer positions. In this course, Robin Andrews takes a deep dive into the concepts, techniques, and applications of recursion using Python. He starts with some real-world examples of recursion, and then shows how it pertains to software development. He covers classic recursive algorithms like factorials and Fibonacci numbers, before showing how to write recursive algorithms in Python through practice exercises. After completing this course, you will have a better idea of how to use recursive algorithms to solve a wide range of software development issues.

## Instructions

### GitHub CodeSpaces

Most of this course can be completed in a browser using GitHub CodeSpaces. There is a video near the start of the course explaining how to do this.

### Installing Python

If you wish to work on your machine locally, you will need to install Python 3, available from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Branches

> Please note: the solutions to many of the exercises in this course are available on the `main` branch, and it may be more convient to look for them there than switching to the end branch for each video.

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
